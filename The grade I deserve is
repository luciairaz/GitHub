In my opinion the grade I deserve is more than a 6 because I have successfully created a profile with the profile picture. After
I created a new repository and was able to clone it in my computer with the terminal. I succesfully made collaborations with some 
of my collegues. I also make a LICENSE and a .gitignore file in Python language. The README.md file with some pictures can be seen 
in my repository, in my profile, called Bioinformatics-.
